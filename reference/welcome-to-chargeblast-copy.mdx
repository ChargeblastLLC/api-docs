1. **4 VISA ARN codes** \- these can be found on Stripe under refunds that were processed greater than 7 days ago. VISA's will have a 4 in the second digit, like this: 74208352536000013652530
2. **Billing Descriptors** \- very important, you provide us with **all** your billing descriptors, including shortened. On Stripe this can be found in the settings page [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).

Please allow up to 48 hours for Ethoca and CDRN alerts to be sent, and up to 1-2 weeks for RDR alerts. Once you have this info, make an account on our website [here](https://app.chargeblast.com/auth/registration), and follow the onboarding instructions.
