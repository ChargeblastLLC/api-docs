Next enter a private api key from Klaviyo, which you can obtain via Klaviyo [here](https://www.klaviyo.com/create-private-api-key).

From here, paste the api key into Chargeblast and you are all set!

You should now see a new metric in your Klaviyo account, called "Predispute Notification" which will be triggered for any Chargeblast alert where an exact order can be matched.
