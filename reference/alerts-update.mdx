title: "Update Alert"
description: "Update the state of an alert to properly inform the banks of whether or not a refund will be issued. If an alert is left unactioned for 72 hours it will be automatically declined. For best results mark alerts as resolved within 24 hours of receiving them (some smaller banks will escalate quarantined transactions as soon as 24 hours within propogating an alert). While our API supports multiple updates, only the first response is respected by the banks."
