## Base URL

The Chargeblast API is built on **REST** principles. We enforce **HTTPS** in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.chargeblast.com
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an [API key](https://app.chargeblast.com/settings/developer) as a _query parameter_ in each request, like so:

```
https://api.chargeblast.com/health?api_key=phkey_123456789
```

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How does pagination work?">
  For endpoints that are paginated, you can simply pass in `?per=100&page=0` as
  query string parameters (where the page starts at index = 0).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do you handle versioning?">
  Versioning is done in the route of the endpoint itself. We are currently on
  version 2 of our API, and all our routes will be prefixed by v2. For example
  `/api/v2/alerts`.
