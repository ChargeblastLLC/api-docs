## Base URL

The Chargeblast API is built on **REST** principles. We enforce **HTTPS** in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.chargeblast.com
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an [API key](https://app.chargeblast.com/settings/developer) as a _query parameter_ in each request, like so:

```
https://api.chargeblast.com/health?api_key=phkey_123456789
```
