title: "Chargeblast Embedded Guide"
---

There are multiple ways to programmatically integrate Chargeblast. This guide is intended for resellers, SaaS tools, payment aggregators, and other merchant of merchant businesses. If you are a merchant yourself, please see our [webhooks](/reference/webhooks), which should be sufficient for most use cases.

If you are using only payment processors that are supported via our [integration directory ](https://www.chargeblast.com/integrations)you can integrate directly via our integrations page and use our workflow builder to set up refund rules.

The integration path depends on whether you'd like to use our matching algorithm, or handle alert to transaction matching yourself.

### Step 1\. Handling of the alerts

#### Client-side matching

- Implement [webhook](/reference/webhooks) to receive alert
- Perform alert to transaction matching internally, refunding cardholder if desired and then update the alert via the [/update/alert](/reference/alerts-update) endpoint

#### Chargeblast matching

- Implement `/orders/upload`endpoint to push order data to Chargeblast
  - Optionally, [if using PSPs we support](https://www.chargeblast.com/integrations), integrate account via our integrations directory.
- Expose [your-domain.com/chargeblast/refund](/reference/refund-endpoint) endpoint to Chargeblast to implement refunds & subscription cancellations

### Step 2\. Passing down costs to merchant

- Poll `/alerts` endpoint (or receive alerts via webhook) and associate each alert with a merchant in our system.
- Bill your merchant accordingly
