## Overview

You are able to set up custom responses for RDR via API. This is intended only to be used by marketplace platforms that require sub-account level RDR responses.

Note

#### Endpoint Requirements

**HTTP Method:** POST  
**Header:** `X-API-Key` (Your unique API key)

Your endpoint should accept a POST request with the API key included in the query string like this:  
`https://your-domain.com/your-endpoint` with X-API-Key in the header.

You can set this URL in your account under developer settings:

#### Request Body

The request body will include the necessary details for processing a refund. This will be in JSON format (details of the request structure can be provided based on your specific requirements).

Here's an example request body:

```json
{
  "action": "Resolved"
}
```

#### Response

Your endpoint must return a response that conforms to the following payload:

```json
{
  "code": "Resolved"
}
```

The potential responses are:

- Resolved - the RDR alert should be accepted - i.e. refunded by Visa.
- Declined - the RDR alert should be rejected - i.e. turn into a chargeback.

Return with a 200 status code in either scenario.
