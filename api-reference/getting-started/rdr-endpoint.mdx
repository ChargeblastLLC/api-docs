title: "RDR Action Endpoint"
---

## Overview

You are able to set up custom responses for RDR via API. This is intended only to be used by marketplace platforms that require sub-account level RDR responses.

<Danger>
  If your endpoint goes down or fails to respond, alerts cannot be retried and
  you may receive chargebacks. To avoid this, please make sure your
  implementation is reliable. If your endpoint is unresponsive or times out, the
  RDR will turn into a chargeback.
</Danger>

#### Endpoint Requirements

**HTTP Method:** POST  
**Header:** `X-API-Key` (Your unique API key)

Your endpoint should accept a POST request with the API key included in the header:
`https://your-domain.com/your-endpoint`

You can set this URL in your account under developer settings:

#### Request Body

The request body will include the necessary details for determining how to action the RDR alert.
Note your endpoint need ony return an accepted/declined response - no refund is actually performed within your implementation. Refunds for RDR are performed directly via Visa in realtime based on your response. Your endpoint must respond in 1.5 seconds.

Here's an example request body:

```json
{
  "arn": "24112315071512011675836",
  "type": "Fraud", // or "NotFraud"
  "authCode": "013A3B",
  "first6": "424242",
  "last4": "1234",
  "descriptor": "NIKE SHOES",
  "currency": "USD",
  "amount": "45.15" // amount (not in cents)
}
```

#### Response

Your endpoint must return a response that conforms to the following payload:

```json
{
  "code": "Resolved"
}
```

The potential responses are:

- Resolved - the RDR alert should be accepted - i.e. refunded by Visa.
- Declined - the RDR alert should be rejected - i.e. turn into a chargeback.

Return with a 200 status code in either scenario.

<Info>
  Once you have implemented this endpoint, please reach out to your account
  manager to migrate RDR decisioning logic to API. This will take 1-2 business
  days.
