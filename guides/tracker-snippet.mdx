title: "Tracker Snippet Guide"

<Info>
There are two paths to enriching charge data and making your transactions compelling evidence eligible. You can either implement the [upload-orders](https://docs.chargeblast.com/api-reference/sync-data/upload-orders) endpoint, or simply integrate the javascript snippet. 
</Info>
This guide will help you implement the Chargeblast tracker snippet on your website.

## Quick Start

Add this snippet to your website's `<head>` section. Your `account_id` starts with "acct_" and can be found under the [settings tab](https://app.chargeblast.com/settings) here.

```html
<script defer 
src="https://cdn.cgb.la/v1/scripts.js" 
data-account="YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" 
id="chargeblast-script">
</script>
```

Then make an API call somewhere to identify a user:
```javascript
Chargeblast.identify("hello@chargeblast.com")
```

## Confirming It Worked

Once your code is live, you will see the widget is installed successfully. You can verify the installation under the [digital receipts tab](https://app.chargeblast.com/clarity)
